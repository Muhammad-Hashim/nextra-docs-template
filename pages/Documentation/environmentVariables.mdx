# List of environment variables

 1. Global Variables 

 2. File Specific Variables



That control tinygrad behavior.
This is a list of environment variable that control the runtime behavior of tinygrad and its examples.
Most of these are self-explanatory, and are usually used to set an option at runtime.

Example: `GPU=1 DEBUG=4 python3 -m pytest`

However you can also decorate a function to set a value only inside that function.

```python copy
# in tensor.py (probably only useful if you are a tinygrad developer)
@Context(DEBUG=4)
def numpy(self) -> ...
```

Or use contextmanager to temporarily set a value inside some scope:

```python  copy
with Context(DEBUG=0):
  a = Tensor.ones(10, 10)
  a *= 2
```
